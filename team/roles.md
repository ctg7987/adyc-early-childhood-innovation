## Team Dynamics

### Our Strengths

### Our Strengths

**Complementary Skillsets:**
The team's success came from diverse expertise across business, technology, design, and domain knowledge. Mohammed and Nigel's business acumen, Calvin's technical skills, Minn's design expertise, and Mahwan's early childhood development knowledge created a well-rounded team capable of building a comprehensive solution.

**Collaboration Style:**
The team worked in an agile, iterative manner with daily check-ins and rapid feedback loops. Each member took ownership of their domain while maintaining open communication and collaborative problem-solving.

**Problem-Solving Approach:**
User-centered design methodology combined with lean startup principles. The team validated assumptions quickly through user interviews, built MVPs to test hypotheses, and iterated based on feedback.

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Defining the Right Scope**
   - The situation: Initially, the team had ambitious ideas that would be difficult to prototype in 54 hours
   - How we solved it: Prioritized core features that demonstrated value proposition and focused on creating a compelling narrative
   - What we learned: Focus and clarity are more valuable than feature completeness in a hackathon setting

2. **Balancing User Needs Across Demographics**
   - The situation: Fathers have diverse backgrounds, schedules, and needs making it challenging to design for everyone
   - How we solved it: Created user personas and focused on common pain points while ensuring the platform could scale to accommodate diversity
   - What we learned: Start with a clear primary user and expand from there
