## 📋 Problem Space

Early childhood development (ages 0-6) is a critical period that shapes lifelong outcomes in education, health, and social-emotional wellbeing. However, significant challenges exist:

- **Limited Access**: Many families lack access to quality early childhood resources and guidance
- **Information Gap**: Parents and educators struggle to find evidence-based, culturally relevant information
- **Engagement**: Traditional approaches often fail to engage children meaningfully during critical developmental windows
- **Measurement**: Difficulty tracking developmental milestones and identifying intervention opportunities early
- **Scalability**: Quality early childhood programs are often expensive and difficult to scale

These challenges are particularly acute in rapidly developing regions where traditional support systems may be changing, and new solutions are needed to support modern families.
